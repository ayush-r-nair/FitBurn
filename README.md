# FitBurn - Calorie Burn Prediction Model

**FitBurn** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict calorie burn based on various input features such as activity level, age, weight, and more. This model can help individuals better understand their calorie expenditure and plan their fitness and health goals accordingly.

## Features

- **Accurate Calorie Prediction**: Predict calorie burn based on input parameters.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can provide details like weight, height, age, gender, and activity type.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting parameters (if integrated with a front-end).
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle additional features and larger datasets.

## Project Overview

The **FitBurn** project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Dataset containing features like age, gender, height, weight, activity type, and calorie burn was used.
   - The data was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accuracy.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Machine learning algorithms were explored, and the most suitable model was chosen.
   - The model was trained on historical data to predict calorie expenditure.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model was evaluated on test data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   - Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score were used for validation.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The trained model can be integrated into a web or mobile application for real-time predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data processing
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for development
  - GitHub for version control
